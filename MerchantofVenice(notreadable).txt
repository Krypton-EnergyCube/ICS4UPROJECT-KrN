LORENZO:
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honor,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.
;;;
PORTIA:
I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now; for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestowed
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish cruelty!
This comes too near the praising of myself.
Therefore no more of it. Hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord’s return.
For mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here
Until her husband and my lord’s return.
There is a monastery two miles off,
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition,
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.
;;;
LORENZO:
Madam, with all my heart.
I shall obey you in all fair commands.
;;;
PORTIA:
My people do already know my mind
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.
;;;
LORENZO:
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
;;;
JESSICA:
I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.
;;;
PORTIA:
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.
;;;
LAUNCELOT:
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to
be laid upon the children. Therefore I promise ye I
fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I
speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be o' good
cheer, for truly I think you are damned. There is but
one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but
a kind of bastard hope neither.
;;;
LAUNCELOT:
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.
;;;
LAUNCELOT:
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother. Thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into
Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways.
;;;
LAUNCELOT:
Truly, the more to blame he. We were Christians eno'
before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs. If
we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have
a rasher on the coals for money.
;;;
JESSICA:
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelot and I are
out. He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in
heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you
are no good member of the commonwealth, for in
converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of
pork.
;;;
LAUNCELOT:
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason.
But if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed
more than I took her for.
